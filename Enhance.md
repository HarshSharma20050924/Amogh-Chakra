You are an elite-level frontend architect, motion designer, and interaction engineer.

You are NOT building a normal website.
You are transforming an already well-designed system into a
**living, cinematic, high-trust digital sanctum**.

Project: AMOGH CHAKRA  
Domain: Indian Astrology / Spiritual Authority  
Audience: People who seek guidance and must instantly feel trust, depth, and calm power.

The current system already exists.
Your job is to **EVOLVE IT**, not simplify it.

Do NOT:
– Make it generic
– Make it flashy
– Make it corporate
– Make it trendy for trend’s sake

The result must feel:
Quietly powerful  
Rare  
Timeless  
Intentional  
Alive  

────────────────────────────────
CORE DIRECTIVE
────────────────────────────────
Enhance EVERY component visually, behaviorally, and emotionally.

Each component must:
– Feel handcrafted, not assembled
– Have depth without noise
– Communicate authority without arrogance
– Use motion as meaning, not decoration

The site should feel closer to:
A luxury temple + observatory + archive  
NOT a marketing website.

────────────────────────────────
TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────
Use the latest stable, production-grade tools where appropriate:

• React + TypeScript (retain structure)
• Tailwind CSS (extend theme, do not bloat)
• Framer Motion (advanced usage)
• CSS variables for theme depth
• GPU-friendly animations only
• Intersection Observer for scroll intelligence
• requestAnimationFrame for ambient motion
• No heavy libraries unless justified

Optional but encouraged:
• Subtle WebGL / Canvas effects ONLY if they are calm and restrained
• Masking, noise textures, grain overlays (very subtle)
• Dynamic lighting effects via gradients and opacity

────────────────────────────────
ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────────────
Animation must feel:
– Organic
– Breath-like
– Physically believable
– Emotionally slow

Rules:
• Prefer springs with low stiffness, high damping
• Ease curves must feel human, not mathematical
• No fast entrances
• No attention-grabbing motion
• Idle animations should feel like “presence”, not movement

Think:
Stone breathing.
Light drifting.
Space rotating slowly.

────────────────────────────────
GLOBAL ENHANCEMENTS (APPLY EVERYWHERE)
────────────────────────────────
• Introduce micro-depth using:
  – layered shadows
  – atmospheric gradients
  – subtle grain/noise
• Improve spacing rhythm (vertical cadence matters)
• Strengthen typographic hierarchy using scale, not weight
• Replace flat sections with spatial sections
• Use negative space aggressively

────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT EVOLUTION REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────

Enhance EACH of the following so it feels like a premium, non-generic system:

App.tsx  
– Introduce global presence layers (ambient motion, light, depth)
– Manage page-level transitions like scenes, not routes

Navbar.tsx  
– Make it feel ceremonial, not navigational
– Scroll morphing should feel inevitable, not triggered
– Language toggle must feel intentional and sacred

Intro.tsx  
– Elevate it into a true “threshold experience”
– Make entry feel like crossing into another space
– Time, blur, scale, and soundlessness matter

Hero.tsx  
– Make it cinematic, not slideshow-based
– Visuals must feel vast and controlled
– Text should feel carved into space, not overlaid

About.tsx  
– Transform it into a reverent narrative
– Image and text must feel bonded, not side-by-side
– Floating elements should feel gravitational

Achievements.tsx  
– Push the cosmic concept further without spectacle
– The zodiac wheel must feel ancient and massive
– Cards should feel like artifacts, not UI

Services.tsx  
– Remove “menu” feeling completely
– Services should feel discovered, not listed
– Overlays and modals must feel architectural

Archive.tsx  
– Make it feel like a living archive, not a gallery
– Media should feel embedded in time
– Hover states must feel cinematic

SocialFeed.tsx  
– Eliminate social-media “noise”
– Make content feel curated, ceremonial, selective

FloatingContact.tsx  
– Must feel like a summoned tool, not a widget
– Motion should feel magnetic, not mechanical

Footer.tsx  
– The ending must feel conclusive and calm
– Like closing a sacred book, not reaching a website bottom

────────────────────────────────
ADD NEW ADVANCED SYSTEM COMPONENTS
────────────────────────────────
Only add components that increase depth and authority:

• AmbientPresenceLayer (global, slow, barely noticeable)
• SectionAtmosphere (per-section lighting/mood control)
• SacredDivider (animated geometry, not lines)
• ScrollEnergyController (scroll speed influences motion subtly)
• QuietReveal (replaces standard fade/slide animations)
• RitualButton (buttons feel pressed with weight, not clicked)

────────────────────────────────
DATA & ARCHITECTURE RULES
────────────────────────────────
• Respect existing data-driven architecture
• Do NOT hardcode content
• All enhancements must work with current seed.ts
• Types must remain strict and expressive
• Components must stay reusable and composable

────────────────────────────────
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────
• No generic UI patterns
• No default animations
• No loud gradients
• No obvious inspiration from SaaS, dashboards, or portfolios
• Everything must feel purpose-built for THIS brand

────────────────────────────────
FINAL EXPECTATION
────────────────────────────────
When someone opens the site, the immediate subconscious reaction should be:

“This is not a normal website.”
“This feels serious.”
“This feels old, wise, and precise.”
“I trust whoever built this.”

Enhance the system accordingly.
